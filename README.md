 1. This notebook and app are using relativedelta from dateutil.relativedelta:
 2. [Specific Source for above](https://renanmf.com/how-to-subtract-months-from-a-date-in-python/#:~:text=The%20easiest%20way%20to%20subtract,to%20use%20the%20dateutil%20extension.&text=The%20relativedelta%20object%20from%20the,months%20from%20a%20date%20object)
 3. ...but all google results pointed me to the same import to deduct by months
 4. I also added the inspector from sqlalchemy import to see tables
 5. Mostly ripped from coursework
 6. I guess chatgpt can be helpful
